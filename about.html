		  <p>Generating realistic and aesthetic pieces has been considered as one of the most exciting tasks in the field of AI.Recent years have seen major progress in generating images, videos and text, notably using GANâ€™s.Generating piano-rolls is challenging because of large number of possible active notes per time step and the involvement of multiple instruments.Recent years have seen increasing research on symbolic domain music generation and composition using deep neural networks.

		  <p>The technology that we have used in our project is based on GANS. A Generative Adversial Network has two core components a generator G and a discriminator D.The former takes as input a random vector z sample from a prior distribution pz and generates a fake sample G(z).
D takes as input either real data x or fake data generated by G.During training time, D learns to distinguish the fake samples from the real ones,whereas G learns to fool D.
In this Generative adversial networks , we mainly use three models namely Jamming model ,Composer model and Hybrid model.
